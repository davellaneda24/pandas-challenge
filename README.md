In this challenge, we are observing reading and math test scores for students in different schools to see if there is any correlation between spending budgets, school size, and school type and the pass rate precentage.

Based on the data, it does appear that there is a correlation between school size and the percentage of passing reading and math scores. With 66.5% of students passing reading, 80.5% of students passing math, and 53.7% of students passing overall, large schools had a much lower pass rate in these subjects when compared to small and medium sized schools, which had over 90% of their students passing in these subjects.

From the data collected, it does appear that an budget amount actually has a negative correlation on math and reading test scores. Schools with the smallest per student budget (93.5% passing reading, 96.6% passing math, and 90.4% passing overall) significantly outperformed those with the largest per student budget (66.2% passing reading, 81.1% passing math, 53.5% passing overall).

Based on the data, charter schools have had a higher percentage of their students pass both reading and math. With pass rates of 93.6% for reading, 96.6% for math , and 90.4% overall; charter schools significantly outperformed district schools which only had 66.5% passing reading, 80.8% passing math, and 53.7% passing overall.
